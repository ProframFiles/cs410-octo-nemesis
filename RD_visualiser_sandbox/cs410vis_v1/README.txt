So far, I've used the d3.js example on http://bl.ocks.org/rkirsling/5001347 to do a bit of experimenting around the JSON format we're using. I think that bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4062045 could also be useful. Some TODO stuff is listed in classvis.js. 


VERSION DEPRECATED - do not remove, may be useful later when we need directed connections
