Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages, 1998</h4><p><strong>Abstract</strong><blockquote>While class-based object-oriented programming languages provide a
flexible mechanism for re-using and managing related pieces of
code, they typically lack linguistic facilities for specifying a
uniform extension of many classes with one set of fields and
methods.  As a result, programmers are unable to express certain
abstractions over classes.</p>
<p>
In this paper we develop a model of class-to-class functions that
we refer to as <em>mixins</em>.  A mixin function maps a class to an
extended class by adding or overriding fields and methods.
Programming with mixins is similar to programming with single
inheritance classes, but mixins more directly encourage
programming to interfaces.</p>
<p>
The paper develops these ideas within the context of Java.  The
results are
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>an intuitive model of an essential Java subset;
</p>
<li><p>an extension that explains and models mixins; and
</p>
<li><p>type soundness theorems for these languages.
</p>
</ol><p>.</blockquote></p><h4>Paper</h4> <p><a href="paper.ps">PostScript</a><br></p><hr><p><small>These papers may differ in formatting from the versions that appear in print.
