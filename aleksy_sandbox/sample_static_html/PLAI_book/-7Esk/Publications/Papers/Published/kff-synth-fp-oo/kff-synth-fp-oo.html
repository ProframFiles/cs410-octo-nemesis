to Promote Re-Use</h2><h3>Shriram Krishnamurthi, Matthias Felleisen, Daniel     P.&nbsp;Friedman</h3><h4>European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, 1998</h4><p><strong>Abstract</strong><blockquote>Many problems require recursively specified types of data and a
collection of tools that operate on those data. Over time, these
problems evolve so that the programmer must extend the toolkit or
extend the types and adjust the existing tools
accordingly. Ideally, this should be done without modifying
existing code. Unfortunately, the prevailing program design
strategies do not support both forms of extensibility: functional
programming accommodates the addition of tools, while
object-oriented programming supports either adding new tools or
extending the data set, but not both. In this paper, we present a
composite design pattern that synthesizes the best of both
approaches and in the process resolves the tension between the two
design strategies. We also show how this protocol suggests a new
set of linguistic facilities for languages that support class
systems.</blockquote></p><h4>Paper</h4> <p><a href="paper.ps">PostScript</a><br></p><hr><p><small>These papers may differ in formatting from the versions that appear in print.
